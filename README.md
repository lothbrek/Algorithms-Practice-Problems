* Algorithms and Practice problems in Python, Ruby, Javascript, and JQuery
This repo is for me to practice algorithms and improve my programming skills by practicing problems from problem sites like Project Euler, Hackerrank, and LeetCoder. This is an attempt to consolidate a few of my problem solving repos. If there are any questions or suggestions, please make an issue or e-mail me, and I will try to respond within 24 hours.

* Current Status
Currently, all of my algorithms are in python. I will be changing this folder to include Ruby and Javascript implementations of each, as well as adding a Data Structures file possibly. If I do so, it will likely be in Java or Python.

* There is a folder for everything separately right now. Project Euler for example will have a Javascript folder and a Ruby folder, alternating problems. Later on, I will have a solution for both Ruby and Javascript. The same will be true of Hackerrank and Leetcoder. I may add python implementations as well, but that is still to be seen.

* The RubyProblems folder is not very organized and just contains random Ruby problems I have solved/created for simple practicing. I may possibly add metaprogramming problems as well.
